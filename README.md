What is a Gesture-Based Math Solver?

A Gesture-Based Math Solver is an interactive Python app that:

Tracks your hand movements

Recognizes how many fingers you show

Converts those into numbers or operations

Evaluates the expression in real-time

All using just your webcam + hands + Python magic!

🎯 What You Will Learn

✅ Real-time webcam input using OpenCV

✅ Hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe

✅ Finger counting logic with Python

✅ Building and evaluating expressions

✅ Gesture commands like “delete”, “clear”, “exit”

📷 How it Works – Behind the Scenes

Step-by-Step Process:

Start Webcam

OpenCV captures your video feed in real time.

Detect Hands

MediaPipe finds and tracks your hand landmarks (21 points per hand).

Count Fingers

















Explanation of Key Modules


🧠 OpenCV

Captures video from the webcam

Flips the frame (mirror effect)

Displays text like Expression: and Result:

✋ MediaPipe

Detects your hand

Tracks finger tips and joints in real-time

Provides landmark points for every finger


📏 NumPy

Used to calculate distance between index fingers

Helps detect gestures like exit (when two index fingers are close)


🧮 Python eval()

Takes your expression like 2+3*4

Returns result: 14


📌 Example: Real-Life Use Case

You do the following:

✌ Show 2 fingers → Adds 2

☝✌ Show 1 + 2 fingers → Adds -

🤞 Show 3 fingers → Adds 3

👊👊 Closed fists → Triggers = 

👉 Output:

Expression: 2-3

Result: -1

Operators (+, −, ×, ÷)

Commands (=, delete, clear, exit)

Build Math Expression

Each gesture adds a part to the expression.

Evaluate Expression

Show the “equal” gesture to solve it.
